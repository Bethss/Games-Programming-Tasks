# Games-Programming-Tasks

Unfortunately this summer has probably been my worst ever, I've been having some family problems and it has severly impacted my ability to dedicate as much time as I would have loved to each of these inidividual projects. I even made custom fonts using photoshop haha

I will likely retake this course!

Happy Summer! Thanks for your time!
